## Flight 2016

[This website](https://waffles.space/flight-2016/) was made for our (Aeronautics) dept. symposium. The goal was to design a responsive website from scratch (using pure HTML/JS/CSS) without the help of any libraries. It works in most of the desktop and mobile browsers (except Safari in iOS, which had some trouble with [one of the pages](https://waffles.space/flight-2016/schedule.html)).
